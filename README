This plugin converts JavaScript anonymous functions to arrow function expressions (introduced in ES 2015).

Place the cursor anywhere inside the function, even on the "function" keyword, and run the JsAnonFnToArrowFn command.

This command is mapped to af unless that is already mapped to something else.
