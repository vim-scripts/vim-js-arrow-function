# vim-js-arrow-function

This plugin converts JavaScript anonymous functions
to arrow function expressions (introduced in ES 2015).

Place the cursor anywhere inside the function,
even on the "function" keyword,
and run the JsAnonFnToArrowFn command.

This command is mapped to <leader>af
unless that is already mapped to something else..

The easiest way to install this is to use Pathogen and
"git clone" this repository into the .vim/bundle directory.
